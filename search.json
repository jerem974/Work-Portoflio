    "text": "Hi, I’m Jeremy.\n\n\nThanks for visiting my website fellow scientist – Let’s dive together in the incredible world of (Bacterio)Phages! Here you’ll find everything you want to know about me (I hope!)\n\nI’m a PhD student in the Fineran group at the University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand. I study plasmid-borne antibiotic resistance and phage defense systems in the context of Phage Therapy. I got into phages reading the Good Virus (Tom Ireland) and I’ve stucked with them! How cool is it to study LEM-looking like viruses everyday?\nI’m a big fan of adventuring and exploring nature’s craziest evolution. I’m always on the hunt for some exploration & finding out what natures has to offer! When it comes to work, I love the lab! Give me a petri dish of bacteria, and I’ll make millions (of phages, of course!).\nFun fact, I grew up on Reunion Island - you won’t hear that everyday! I bet you a post-doc contract you can’t locate it on a map! Check it out: To Reunion Island blog\n\n📄 View CV 🎙️ View Talks history 📚 View Publication Records\n💼 Browse my Projects 👋 Get to know me!\n\nSometimes, work follows you along even during you adventures!

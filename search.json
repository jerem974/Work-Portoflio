(https://www.otago.ac.nz/microbiology-and-immunology/our-people/peter-fineran) I’ve had a diverse academic journey which took me in Cambridge (England), Marseille (France), Grenoble (France), Canberra (Australia), Reunion (France) and Dunedin (New Zealand). I hold a Bachelor degrees of Biology & Life Sciences from the University of Grenoble which I topped with a HonsBsc of Science at the University of Otago before finally taking the big leap: The PhD.\nSuccess comes from More info here\nFun fact, I grew up on Reunion Island - you won’t hear that everyday! I bet you a post-doc contract you can’t locate it on a map! Check it out: [Insert website]\nWhen it comes to work, I love improving the efficiency and reproducibility of our workflows. More here\nThanks for being a part of my journey.

# Hi, Iâ€™m Jeremy.

I study plasmid-borne antibiotic resistance and phage defense systems.

I'm also a big fan of nature's craziest evolution outcomes: Have you seen a male and a female Anglerfish reproduce???

Hi there! ![](assets/img/JR-logo.webp){.img-va-bottom fig-alt="cat with tail shaped as the letter J next to last name initial R" width="100"}

Thanks for visiting my website fellow scientist -- Let's dive together in the incredible world of (Bacterio)Phages!

I'm a PhD student in the Fineran group (Phi Lab) at the University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand. (https://www.otago.ac.nz/microbiology-and-immunology/our-people/peter-fineran)

I've had a diverse academic journey which took me to:

-   Cambridge (England) - English gap year

-   Marseille (France) - 1st year Bachelor

-   Grenoble (France) - 2nd year Bachelor

-   Canberra (Australia) - 3rd year Bachelor

-   Reunion (France) - Research assistant in Virology

-   Dunedin (New Zealand) - Research assistant in Virology/Honours/PhD

    Success comes from More info here

Fun fact, I grew up on Reunion Island - you won't hear that everyday! I bet you a post-doc contract you can't locate it on a map! Check it out: \[Insert website\]

When it comes to work, I love improving the efficiency and reproducibility of our workflows. More here

Thanks for being a part of my journey. I'm by no means an expert at anything, but I plan on using this space to learn out loud!

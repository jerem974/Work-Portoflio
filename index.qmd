# Hi, Iâ€™m Jeremy.

I study plasmid-borne antibiotic resistance and phage defense systems in the context of Phage Therapy

I'm also a big fan of nature's craziest evolution: Have you seen a male and a female Anglerfish reproduce?

Hi there!

Thanks for visiting my website fellow scientist -- Let's dive together in the incredible world of (Bacterio)Phages!

I'm a PhD student in the Fineran group (Phi Lab) at the University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand. [To PhiLab homepage](https://www.otago.ac.nz/microbiology-and-immunology/our-people/peter-fineran){.btn .cta}

I've had a diverse academic journey which took me to:

-   Cambridge (England) - English gap year

-   Marseille (France) - 1st year Bachelor

-   Grenoble (France) - 2nd year Bachelor

-   Canberra (Australia) - 3rd year Bachelor

-   Reunion (France) - Research assistant in Virology

-   Dunedin (New Zealand) - Research assistant in Virology/Honours/PhD

    Success comes from More info here

Fun fact, I grew up on Reunion Island - you won't hear that everyday! I bet you a post-doc contract you can't locate it on a map! Check it out: [To Reunion Island blog](https://en.reunion.fr/organize/blog/)

When it comes to work, I love the lab! Give me a petri dish of bacteria, and I'll make millions (of phages, of course!).

Sometimes, work follows you along even during you adventures! ![light_painting_phage](assets/img/light_phages.jpg) *Phage infecting a bacterium, Trotter's Gorge, Lab tremp - July 2024*

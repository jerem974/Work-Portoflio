# Hi, I’m Jeremy.

![](assets/img/site_banner.png){width=100% fig-alt="Collage of lab & phage images"}

::: {.text-center}
***Thanks for visiting my website fellow scientist -- Let's dive together in the incredible world of (Bacterio)Phages! Here you'll find everything you want to know about me (I hope!) and about phages!***
:::

I'm a PhD student in the [Fineran group](https://www.otago.ac.nz/microbiology-and-immunology/our-people/peter-fineran){.badge .bg-warning-subtle} at the University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand. I study plasmid-borne antibiotic resistance and phage defense systems in the context of Phage Therapy. I got into phages reading the Good Virus (Tom Ireland) and I've stucked with them! How cool is it to study Lunar-Exploration-Module-looking like viruses everyday? 

I'm a big fan of adventuring and exploring nature's craziest evolution. I'm always on the hunt for some exploration & finding out what natures has to offer!
When it comes to work, I love the lab! Give me a petri dish of bacteria, and I'll make millions (of phages, of course!).

Fun fact, I grew up on ***Reunion Island*** - you won't hear that everyday! **I bet you a post-doc contract** that you can't locate it on a map! Check it out: [To Reunion Island blog](https://en.reunion.fr/organize/blog/)

Hi there! ![](assets/img/JR-logo.webp){.img-va-bottom fig-alt="cat with tail shaped as the letter J next to last name initial R" width="100"}

Thanks for visiting my website fellow scientist -- Let's dive together in the incredivle world of (Bacterio)Phages!

I'm a PhD student in the Fineran group (Phi Lab) at the University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.  (https://www.otago.ac.nz/microbiology-and-immunology/our-people/peter-fineran)
I've had a diverse academic journey which took me in Cambridge (England), Marseille (France), Grenoble (France), Canberra (Australia), Reunion (France) and Dunedin (New Zealand). I hold a Bachelor degrees of Biology & Life Sciences from the University of Grenoble which I topped with a HonsBsc of Science at the University of Otago before finally taking the big leap: The PhD. 

Success comes from More info here

Fun fact, I grew up on Reunion Island - you won't hear that everyday! I bet you a post-doc contract you can't locate it on a map!

When it comes to work, I love improving the efficiency and reproducibility of our workflows. More here 

Thanks for being a part of my journey. I'm by no means an expert at anything, but I plan on using this space to learn out loud!
